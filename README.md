# Linear-Regression-implementation
In this little project we're going to implement a linear regression using the method of **"Least Squares"**, which is **one of the optimization methods** to minimize the cost function and thus solve linear regression.

Exists other algorithms for optimization like the **gradient descent** but we're going to see that in another project. :)

For this project we're going to use the "Boston House prices" where we will try to predict the price of a house according to the number of rooms per dwelling. We use just one parameter to visualize it in a 2D plane and we could see our model.

**_This was created in Python 3 using the application Jupyter Notebook._**

## Libraries used
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Sklearn (to use the dataset)
- Matplotlib
