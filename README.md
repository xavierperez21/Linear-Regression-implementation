# Linear-Regression-implementation
In this little project we're going to implement a linear regression using the method of **"Least Squares"**, which is **one of the optimization methods** to minimize the cost function and thus solve linear regression.

Exists other algorithms for optimization like the **gradient descent** but we're going to see that in another project. :)

You can click on the file _Linear_Regression.ipynb_ to see the project with more details.

For this project we're going to use the "Boston House prices" where we will try to predict the price of a house according to the number of rooms per dwelling. We use just one parameter to visualize it in a 2D plane and we could see our model.

**_This was created in Python 3 using the application Jupyter Notebook._**

## Libraries used
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Sklearn (to import the dataset)
- Matplotlib

## Project online
You can see the project working online [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18rZmw9zkSVmDUQ401X8uOCh1dbjy0dyP?usp=sharing "here")

Once you get there click on the "**Runtime**" option, and then in the "**Run all**" option and you can see the project working. Go to the last line :)
