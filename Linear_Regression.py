# For this project we're going to use the _"Boston House prices"_ where **we will try to predict the price of a house according to the number of rooms per dwelling.** We use just one parameter to visualize it in a 2D plane and we could see our model.

# We load the dataset

# The "Least Squares" formula is the following one: $\beta = (X^{T}X)^{‚Åª1}X^{T}Y$

# X will be the column of the average number of rooms
X = np.array(boston.data[:, 5])

# Y will be the median value of houses in each town (in 1000's)
Y = np.array(boston.target)

# Plotting the data
plt.scatter(X, Y, alpha=0.3)


# Adding column of ones for the independent term

# We apply the least squares formula. "@" is for matrix multiplication.
